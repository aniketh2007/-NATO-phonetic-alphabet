# NATO-phonetic-alphabet
- NATO phonetic alphabets is a project based on the learning of list and dictionary comprehension. Where the user types the string and it gives NATO phonetic alphabets.
- Step 1 : It is create a dictionary of the csv file by using the dictionary comprehension and by using .iterrows() method. And to check if it created or not.
- Step 2 : To create a list of phonetic alphabets from the words which are given by user. We use input() method to take input from the user. We use list comperhension to loop through the words of the user input then to print the letters by accessing the keys we can print the values in the dictionary.
- Implemented a new concept of learning about Exception handling.Where we check if the user entered any unexpected inputs other than words.
- We take the user input and not include that inside the try inside we loop through each of the keys check if it exists. In except we catch the Keyerror. And print a prompt to enter words and recalled the method again so that the user enters input and in else print out the LIst of Phonetic alphabets.
